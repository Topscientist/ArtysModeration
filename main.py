So, you know how nower days a lot of discord servers have widley used mod bots and while this can be good it means that sometimes these bots can be a bit slow at doing their job, And thats where Artys Moderation comes into play! Because of my light code-base and good hosting I can get down on those bad words and keep your chat clean and fresh, I also have a feature called cheer up! The premise of this feature is to detect when a user is feeling sad and send them a message of encourgement! I am always adding new features and listening to feedback so if you have any suggestions then please do leave them in my discord, I would love to hear them!",
